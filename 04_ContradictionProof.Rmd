# Contradiction Proof

\begin{claim}{1}

Let $f:A\to B$ be an injective function. Prove for every $y\in B$, one has that either $f^{-1}(\{y\})=\emptyset$ or $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ contains only one element.

\end{claim}

\begin{proof}

We proceed by contradiction. 

Assume that there is some $y \in B$  such that $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ has two or more elements. 

Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two distinct elements in $f^{-1}(\{y\})$.

Since $f:A\to B$ is an injective function, by definition we have that for every $a, b \in A$ if $f(a) = f(b)$ then it follows that $a = b$. 

Note that by the definition of the preimage we know that $x_1 \in A$ and $x_2 \in A$. We also have that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ because both elements are in the preimage. Then it follows that $x_1 = x_2$. However, this is a contradiction because $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two distinct elements. 

Thus we have that there cannot be some $y \in B$  such that $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ has two or more elements and we have shown the initial statement as desired.

\end{proof}
