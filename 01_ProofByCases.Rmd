# Proof By Cases (Triangle Inequality)

\begin{thm}[{\tt The Triangle Inequality}]
For each pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$, one has that:
\[
|x + y|\leq |x| + |y|.
\]
\end{thm}

(Hint: Consider cases like $x,y\geq0$ or $x,y\leq0$ or $x\geq0$ and $y<0$,  etc.. These cases will help you evaluate the absolute value using its definition.)

\begin{proof}
We proceed by cases.


\textbf{Case 1:} $x\geq 0$ and $y \geq 0.$

Note that by the definition of absolute value and since $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$, we have that $|x| = x$ and $|y| = y$ and $|x + y| = x + y$ (since $x + y \geq 0$). 

Thus it follows that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ (since $|x + y| = |x| + |y|$).


\textbf{Case 2:} $x < 0$ and $y < 0.$

Note that by the definition of absolute value and since $x < 0$ and $y < 0$, we have that $|x| = -x$ and $|y| = -y$ and $|x + y| = - (x + y) = -x - y$ (since $x + y < 0$). 

Thus it follows that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ (since $|x + y| = |x| + |y|$).


\textbf{Case 3:} $x\geq 0$ and $y \geq 0.$

Note that by the definition of absolute value and since $x \geq 0$ and $y < 0$, we have that $|x| = x$ and $|y| = -y$. Now we need to consider two subcases in which $|x + y|$ can satisfy $|x + y| \geq 0$ or $|x + y| < 0$. 

Suppose that $|x + y| \geq 0$. By the definition of absolute value it follows that $|x + y| = x + y$. Note that $ x - y \geq x + y$ because y is negative. By substituting we get that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$.

Now suppose that $|x + y| < 0$. Observe that $|x + y| \leq x$. Since y is negative we have that $|x + y| < x - y$. After substituting equivalent values we have that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$.

Since in Case 3 we have that $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary, we have exhausted the cases and we have that  $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ for all $\mathbb{R}$.
